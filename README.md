# Hi, I'm Raj Mars Marni

I love technology and I design secure enterprise cloud infrastructures and applications on AWS, Azure, and other platforms. My work leverages Netflix OSS frameworks and a variety of DevOps automation tools, always adhering to industry standards, best practices, and proven operational procedures.

Broadly speaking, there are two groups of IT professionals:  
Group one pursues IT careers for financial gain.  
Group two is driven by the passion to create unique technological solutions for specific problems and to see them through to completion.  

I belong to the second group. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions—not for titles, power, or money—but because I love the process of invention and problem-solving. With this mindset, I design technological solutions that keep organizations and teams at the forefront of their industries.
